# Learning building CLI using Click

Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.

# Getting Started

1. Install [UV](https://astral.sh/blog/uv): Ensure that you have UV installed in your environment.
2. Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Synchronize the Environment:
Run the command: uv sync --frozen
- Run the command: uv sync --frozen
4. Run the Application: Execute one of the following commands to see the available options:
- For the class-based implementation: ```uv run main_classe_base.py --help```
- For the standard implementation: ```uv run main.py --help```
